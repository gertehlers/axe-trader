# axe-trader — Backlog

## Status
Phase 4 complete. Pre-MVP: priority is a stable monitor pipeline, then strategy accuracy.

---

## In Progress

- [ ] Validate MONITOR mode end-to-end (auth → WebSocket → SQLite writes confirmed)
- [ ] Strategy fine-tuning — iterating toward ~5 quality trades/day with a win rate that shows real edge

---

## Strategy

- [ ] Establish RSI-only baseline — measure win rate before adding complexity
- [ ] Fix entry/exit rules — see pillar analysis below; current win rate ~32%
- [x] Implement SHORT entries — confluence runs bullish votes LONG, bearish votes SHORT
- [x] Layer in 5-pillar confluence toward >85% accuracy target (scoring/voting, threshold-tunable):
  - [x] Pillar 1: Technical indicators — RSI extreme + Bollinger Band touch (bull/bear votes)
  - [x] Pillar 2: Candlestick patterns — engulfing / harami / hammer / shooting-star
  - [x] Pillar 3: Support & resistance levels — close near lookback low/high (ATR proximity)
  - [x] Pillar 4: Chart patterns — break-of-structure proxy (break prior lookback high/low)
  - [x] Pillar 5: Volume / trend confirmation — above-average volume aligned with EMA trend

### Confluence tuning — where we left off (2026-06-14)

Current `application.yaml` settings: threshold 2, RSI 25/75, proximity-atr 0.3, swing-lookback 20.
Dataset: 2078 5m bars ≈ 26.6 trading days.

Pillar combination analysis at these settings (168 trades, 32% win rate, ~6.3/day):

| Combo                           | Count | Win% | Notes                                    |
|---------------------------------|-------|------|------------------------------------------|
| Structure + Vol+Trend           |  55   |  29% | **Noise** — both describe trending bars  |
| RSI+BB + S/R                    |  47   |  34% | Clean mean-reversion at extremes         |
| Candle + Vol+Trend              |  24   |  21% | Weak                                     |
| Candle + S/R                    |  22   |  41% | Good — reversal candle at real level     |
| Candle + Structure + Vol+Trend  |   7   |  43% | Better quality when 3 align              |
| Candle + RSI+BB + S/R           |   1   | 100% | Golden combo, but very rare              |

**Key finding:** Structure (close > prior lookback high) and Vol+Trend (close > EMA + high volume)
are correlated — both fire in trending bars. They generate 55 trades at only 29% win rate.
Removing this pair would cut trades from 168 → 113 and lift overall win rate.

**Next action options:**
- Disable `enable-structure: false` → drops the noisy Structure+Vol+Trend pair entirely
- Keep Structure but redesign it as something less correlated with Vol+Trend (e.g. require
  price to have been *below* the level recently before breaking it)
- Goal: ~5 quality trades/day at materially higher win rate than 32%

---

## Infrastructure

- [ ] Implement TRADE mode order execution (blocked until strategy accuracy is proven)
- [ ] Add risk controls before any live trading (position sizing, max drawdown, circuit breaker)

---

## Completed

- [x] Phase 1–4: Backtest engine, Capital.com REST + WebSocket integration, historical price storage
- [x] TA4j strategy pipeline (BarSeriesFactory → IndicatorBundle → StrategyFactory → BacktestRunner)
- [x] JFreeChart visualisation of backtest results
- [x] SQLite persistence with Flyway migrations
